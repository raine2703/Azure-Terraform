IaaS project to create Windows VM running in Azure.

Resource group name: RG

Networking:
  Virtual Network name: vnet.
  Subnets created based on input value count=var.number-of-subnets.
  Service Endpoint Microsoft.Storage enabled for all subnets.
  NSG that allows RDP and HTTP connections to Vms. Attached to Subnets.
  
Virtual machines:
  VMs, Nics, Public ip addresses created based on var.number-of-machines. Naming automated with ${count.index}.
  Log in passwords used from data.azurerm_key_vault.rkv2703x.id.
  All Virtual machines placed in Availability set.
  
Custom extensions for VMs:
  Installing Web Server on all VMs.
  IIS-Config.ps1 custom script stored in rnstorage2703x56 container named data. 
  Executed as public available script from Azure storage with fileUris parameter.
  
Storage Account
  Automating naming with lower(join("", ["${local.storage_acc_name}", substr(random_uuid.random-uuid.result,0,8)])).
  Firewall rules allowing connections to Storage Account from my ip address and subnets in vnet.
  Idea was to grant access to Storage Account only from VMs in vnet and my personal PC.
